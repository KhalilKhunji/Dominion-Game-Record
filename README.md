# Dominion Game Record
An app that records completed games of the board game [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)). 

Every time you play this game, you randomly select a set of 10 cards to make up your Kingdom; meaning every game of Dominion will be different. This app allows you to record past games to go back to and replay previous Kingdoms that you enjoyed!

# Getting Started
